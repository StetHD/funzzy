# funzzy
The configurable watcher. (Inspired by [antr](https://github.com/juanibiapina/antr))

Run configured commands for differents directories using semantic yaml.

Example:
```yaml
# watch.yaml
# list here all the events and the commands that it should execute

- name: run my tests
  when:
    change: 'tests/**'
    run: make test

- name: compile my sass
  when:
    change: 'src/static/**'
    run: compass

```

## Motivation
Have you ever used another watcher? 

Well I did. The last one was Grunt and It consumes almost all of my computer's resources. 
Funzzy was made by Rust that is way it consumes almost nothing to run.


## Installing
Make sure you have installed the follow dependecies:
- Rust
```bash
make build
```

## Running
Initializing whit boilerplate:
```bash
funzzy init
```
Then run:
```bash
funzzy watch
```
